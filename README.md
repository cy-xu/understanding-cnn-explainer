## Chengyuan (CY) and Navya's plan:

1. Learn/refresh javascript and a number of frameworks/packages used to build CNN Explainer.
2. Dive into the project's code to understand its implementation.
3. Identify obstacles and limitations to decide the direction to further develop/improve on this work.
4. Implement our ideas and deliver.

## Progress tracking:

### Week 4 (Oct 17-21)

Navya (comment branch): going through code to leave comments for questions and understanding components; [Pull request](https://github.com/cy-xu/understanding-cnn-explainer/pull/1);

Chengyuan (tweak branch): still learning JS, [taking notes](./notes/JavaScript_notes.md), looking into D3.js (used in this project for data visualization).

### Week 5 (Oct 23-27)
Navya (merged to main): Documented the java script files for CNN explainer and listed the implementation details in Document.md in src/utils folder.
Started learning Tensorflow.js and D3 for visualization to work on our own model.

Chegyuan(understanding svelete structure and teachable machine branches) : Worked on simple tensorflow.js models and trying to implement different models using this. Created two projects using tensorflow.js so far in tf.js_projects folder.

### Week 6 (October 31 - November 3)

Navya: Finished lessons on tensorflow.js from Edx course. Working on the movenet project in tfjs repo. Discussed about the project plan and about layout of the project.

Chegyuan: Fixed teachable machine code and it is running now. Working on the movenet project. Completed the lessons on tensorflow.js in the edx course. 

### Week 7 (Nov 3 - Nov 10)

Both Chengyuan and Navya are working on getting the tensorflow.js model MoveNet working on glitch to finish the demo.
